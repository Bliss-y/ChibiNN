Tensor is just a multi-dimensional array/grid of numbers

hence a Scalar would be a rank 0 tensor;
Vector is a rank one tensor A column matrix
Matrix is a 2-rank tensor

---------------------------------------------------------------

Tensor is an object that is invariant under change of co-ordinates
and
 has components that change in a special, predictable way under a change of co-ordinates

Forward/backward transformation of a tensor is basically changing a Tensor from one co-ordinate system/ one combination of vector type to another

Co-vector is a linear function of a vector.  it is a row vector that multiplies(dot) a vector(column) to produce a single scalar


Tensor multiplication is basic matrix multiplication.
 However, the first dimensions of the tensors must be equal, and the last dimension of the first tensor must be equal to the second dimension of the matrix
 eg, T(a,b,Tensor.CL) @ T(a,Tensor.CL,d) -> T(a,b,d)
